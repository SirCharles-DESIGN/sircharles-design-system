# SirCharles.DESIGN — Design System

The brand and design system for **SirCharles.DESIGN**, a Product Design Director practice founded by Charles Hurst.

This repository is the source of truth for SirCharles' visual identity, voice, and reusable component code. It is structured to plug directly into [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design)'s "Set up your design system" flow — see [`CLAUDE-DESIGN.md`](./CLAUDE-DESIGN.md) for the field-by-field mapping.

## How to use it

### If you're Claude Design, an AI tool, or an LLM
Read `brand/` for the rules and `tokens/` for the values. The tokens are intentionally named with semantic aliases (`--color-fg-primary`, `--radius-pill`) so you can reason about *why* a value is used, not just what it is. Components in `components/` are real, working HTML you can preview in any browser.

### If you're a human designer
Open the HTMLs in `components/` to see the brand rendered. Read `brand/foundations.md` for the rationale. Use `tailwind.config.js` to set up a new project that matches.

### If you're a developer adopting the system
1. Copy `tokens/*.css` into your project and `@import` them at the top of your stylesheet, OR
2. Copy `tailwind.config.js` and use the utilities (`bg-sc-cyan`, `text-sc-black`, `rounded-sc-pill`, etc.).
3. Reference `components/` for canonical implementations.

## Where this came from

Every value in this repo was extracted from the live theme at sircharles.design on **2026-04-20**. Voice samples are direct quotes from the homepage, /pages/my-work, /pages/about-me, and /pages/contact. Color tokens and font choices match the Shopify theme's CSS exactly.

On **2026-04-24** the package was re-audited against the live DOM using Claude in Chrome. The audit caught a handful of drifts (button base styles, motion timing, a missing white-glow shadow, and the signature button hover interaction). All fixes landed in the `audit/phase-1b-live-site-parity` branch. See `audit/delta-report.md` for the full write-up.

If the live site changes materially, regenerate this package — don't edit it by hand piecemeal.
